        <p>
          Iâ€™m a User Experience Designer, Product Designer and Software Developer 
          with a background in web/game development, prototyping and user testing. 
          I live in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. With my studies in computer 
          science, art and psychology, I design digital products that are functional 
          and beautiful.

      <h2>My Career Journey </h2>
      <div class="resume-top">
      <p>
        My goal is to create intuitive and engaging experiences for users. I excel 
        at taking complex tasks and distilling them down to their core components,
        making them both more accessible and efficient for end-users. My expertise 
        spans multiple programming languages and design applications, allowing me 
        to adapt quickly to new environments and requirements. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently searching for exciting opportunities in the design and 
        technology fields, preferably located in Saskatoon, although I am open to 
        remote positions as well. Ultimately, I strive to work on projects that 
        positively impact our world through technology.

                  As part of a user engagement team for connecting Saskatchewan 
                  residents with art, I solved multiple challenges with innovative 
                  technological solutions. My responsibilities included conducting 
                  research, gathering patron feedback, and creating visualizations 
                  such as personas, service blueprints, journey maps, storyboards, 
                  sitemaps, wireframes, and prototypes. I also participated in 
                  hackathons, explored Augmented Reality designs, addressed 
                  technical issues encountered during development, redesigned 
                  problematic features, composed the brand identity of our products,
                  and presented them at conferences with confidence and clarity.

                  To enhance the online presence of our local art gallery, I 
                  redesigned the website to prioritize usability and accurately 
                  represent our professional galleries, student gallery, and 
                  impressive collection. Prior to beginning the design process, I 
                  conducted research on current challenges and sought inspiration 
                  from leading international gallery sites. Using Figma, I created 
                  detailed wireframes and interactive prototypes that could easily
                  be shared with stakeholders. Facilitating a productive 
                  collaboration with the University of Saskatchewan IT team was 
                  important in this project.

                  Our challenge was to develop a game blending fighting mechanics 
                  with agricultural activities. The development period lasted for 
                  one term with a team of ten members using the programming 
                  language C#. The project encompassed a project pitch, 
                  documentation of assets and requirements, weekly sprint reviews, 
                  showcasing of the prototype, alpha, beta, and the final product 
                  demo. In my capacity as the designated Test Lead, I focused on 
                  implementing unit and functionality tests with players, analysing
                  Unity Analytics, recommending bug resolutions, and balancing the 
                  gameâ€™s features. Additionally, I participated in lead meetings, 
                  assisted in refining the game design, coded specific components 
                  (day-night cycles, illumination systems in 3D/2D, and user 
                  interfaces elements), prepared reports, and actively took part 
                  in the concluding demonstration.

                  We designed and created a single player dungeon crawler game 
                  featuring AI agents for path planning. The game was generated 
                  through infinite procedural content, with adjustable difficulty 
                  to help players succeed. The development spanned one semester, 
                  involving a six-member team working with the C# programming 
                  language. My contributions included the game's overall concept, 
                  visual arts production, audio elements, testing, as well as the 
                  creation of five distinct rewards categories (Access, Facility,

                  model-view-controller architectures, and multiple synchronized

                  state-machine diagrams. The editor allows users to select a tool 
                  from a tool palette. Different tools allow the user to create 
                  state nodes, connect states with transition links, move and edit
                  items in the workspace, and pan the view. A property panel at

                  I built a user interface to demonstrate my skills with both the 
                  iterative design process (task descriptions, sketch-based 
                  prototypes, screen design, and task walkthroughs) and JavaFX 
                  development (widgets, events, layout, and Model-View-Controller).
                  The application is a simple booking system for the University of 
                  Saskatchewanâ€™s tennis courts. I determined the primary tasks for 
                  the Court Booking System, created several design ideas for 
                  supporting those tasks, and developed an MVC-based JavaFX UI 
                  based on one of my designs.

                  I coded a user interface to demonstrate my skills with basic 
                  JavaFX development (including widgets, event handling, layout, 
                  app functionality and the development of composite widgets). 
                  The UI is for a simple JavaFX app that allows the user to set 
                  filters in a list of houses for sale. The app provides controls 
                  for filtering based on price, number of bedrooms, or the area of 
                  the house in square feet. Filters provide range sliders which 
                  allow the user to set both a lower and an upper amount for the 
                  filter. The user can store the current set of filters as a 
                  search; when they do this, the search is added to a second list. 
                  Saved searches can be loaded by selecting them from the list and 
                  clicking a button. The app will help realtors quickly locate 
                  suitable homes to show to their clients.

                  I formulated an infographic for students enrolled in Women and 
                  Gender Studies courses. This resource serves as a reference for 
                  key concepts related to identity and gender that are covered 
                  within the program's curriculum. In the design process, I 
                  employed my proficiency in Adobe Photoshop and InDesign software

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a User Experience Designer, Product Designer and Software Developer 
        driven by a passion for problem-solving and a deep appreciation for beauty 
        in all things. Travel has always been one of my greatest sources of 
        inspiration, which led me to explore New Zealand and Australia for two 
        exhilarating years. Since then, I have had the opportunity to explore 
        different countries such as Japan, China, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Through 
        these cultural experiences, I developed a keen eye for detail and an ability
        to understand people from various walks of life. As a result, my empathy 
        towards human behaviour guides my design process towards solutions that 
        truly resonate with users. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I channel my creative energy into photography, animation, 
        printmaking and fabric dyeing. Not only do these mediums serve as stress 
        relievers after long hours behind the computer screen, but they also 
        allow me to think outside the box when crafting unique and compelling 
        interfaces for the end user. Lastly, hiking, playing soccer, or simply 
        getting my hands dirty gardening help me clear my mind and rejuvenate 
        my spirits so that I can face another day full of challenges head-on. 
        All in all, I believe design is a reflection of our own personality and 
        values, therefore my goal is to create meaningful interactions that 
        leave a lasting impact for people.
